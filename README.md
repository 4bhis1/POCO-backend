# PO-CO


🚀 Introducing PO-CO (Pookie-Coder): Track Your Coding Streaks Across Platforms! 🌟

Are you a passionate coder who loves to maintain streaks, but find it challenging to keep track across multiple platforms? Say hello to PO-CO — a revolutionary tool designed for developers who code everywhere!

💻 What is PO-CO?
PO-CO is a centralized platform that monitors and maintains your coding streaks across various coding platforms, repositories, and learning portals. Whether you're contributing to GitHub, solving problems on LeetCode, exploring new projects on CodePen, or sharpening your skills on HackerRank, PO-CO ensures your streaks are always up-to-date and unified.

📊 Key Features:
1️⃣ Multi-Platform Integration: Seamlessly connect with popular coding platforms.
2️⃣ Real-Time Streak Synchronization: Automatically sync your coding activities.
3️⃣ Customizable Streak Goals: Define what a "coding day" means to you — commits, challenges solved, or projects built.
4️⃣ Insightful Analytics: Visualize your progress with charts, leaderboards, and heatmaps.
5️⃣ Motivation & Rewards: Get badges, challenges, and reminders to keep your streak alive.

🌟 Why PO-CO?
Coding is not limited to a single platform, and neither should your streaks be! PO-CO is here to celebrate your dedication and consistency, regardless of where you code.

💡 Coming Soon!
We’re gearing up for the launch, and we can’t wait to share PO-CO with you. Follow this space for updates, sneak peeks, and exclusive beta invites!
